## What is Risk Management?
Risk management is a systematic process of identifying, 
evaluating, and dealing with possible problems that could affect a business or project. It means looking at things that might go wrong, like money issues, how things are run, or problems with the environment. By doing this, organizations can lower the chances of bad things happening and take advantage of any good opportunities that come up. Good risk management helps with making smart choices, making a business stronger, and making sure goals are reached, even when things are uncertain.

## Traditional vs Enterprise Risk Mangement
In traditional risk management, the focus is on spotting and dealing with risks within specific parts of the organization, like finance, operations, or compliance. Each department creates its own ways to handle risks that relate to its area, leading to separate efforts and not much teamwork between departments. This type of risk management usually deals with risks as they happen in each department, without looking at how they might affect the whole organization.

Enterprise risk management (ERM) looks at risks from all parts of the organization. It understands how risks are connected and how they could affect the organization's goals. ERM makes sure that managing risks fits with the organization's plans and decisions. It involves top managers and the board in deciding which risks are most important. ERM is built into how the organization is run, and it focuses on finding and dealing with risks that could get in the way of reaching big goals. This helps the organization deal with risks before they become big problems and helps it succeed in the long run.

## Lehmans Brothers
The collapse of Lehman Brothers during the 2008 financial crisis illustrates how traditional risk management failed to address significant financial risks. Despite being a major global investment bank, Lehman's bankruptcy highlighted the inadequacy of its risk management practices. Weaknesses in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks ultimately led to severe financial consequences. This case emphasizes the importance of continually improving risk management practices, especially in the face of evolving and interconnected risks in the modern business landscape.
