## Risk Management

## What is Risk Management?
Risk management is a systematic process of identifying, 
evaluating, and dealing with possible problems that could affect a business or project. It means looking at things that might go wrong, like money issues, how things are run, or problems with the environment. By doing this, organizations can lower the chances of bad things happening and take advantage of any good opportunities that come up. Good risk management helps with making smart choices, making a business stronger, and making sure goals are reached, even when things are uncertain.
