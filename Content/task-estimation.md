Assign tasks to team members. 

Start the sprint, do the work. 

Daily stand-ups with SCRUM master. What have you done? What will you do? Any blockers? 

Sprint demo meeting, showcase work done during sprint.

Notes: 

Story point: A story point is a unit of measurement for a user story based on factors such as complexity, effort, uncertainty, and risk.  

Epic: Epics serve as large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller and manageable tasks. 

## What is Task Estimation?
Task Estimation techniques refer to the methods and approaches used to determine or estimate the effort, time, and resources required for testing activities in software development projects. Estimating the testing effort is crucial for effective project planning, resource allocation, and scheduling. It aids in forecasting and allocation of budget and resources for a project.
Why do Software Developers Use Task Estimation?
Task Estimation is used for a variety of important reasons:
-	Project Planning is facilitated by task estimation. Project managers can set realistic deadlines and milestones for the entire project by assessing the time and effort required for each activity. Better coordination of activities and the establishment of attainable goals are made possible by this.

-	Resource Allocation. Project managers may allocate resources efficiently and guarantee that the correct individuals with the required skills are accessible when needed by knowing the burden associated with each assignment. By doing this, bottlenecks are avoided, and human resource utilisation is maximised throughout the project's lifecycle.

-	Controlling Costs. Project managers can create cost estimates using task estimation, which is based on the expected effort and length of jobs. Project managers can take proactive steps to reduce risks and maintain the project within budgetary restrictions by seeing any cost overruns early on. 

-	Risk Management is intrinsically related to Task Estimation. Precise approximations aid in detecting possible hazards linked to timetable setbacks, insufficient resources, or technological difficulties. Project managers can reduce risks and guarantee project success by creating backup plans and allocating resources in accordance with the uncertainty surrounding each activity.
